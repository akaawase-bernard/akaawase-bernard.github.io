I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Marine Science department](https://marinesciences.uconn.edu/) at University of connecticut, working with [Professor Leonel Romero](https://marinesciences.uconn.edu/person/leonel-romero/).

My thesis will investigate the bimoldality of wind-wave spectrum in the context of air-sea interaction. In general, my research interests include ocean remote sensing, surface waves, interaction with structures, ocean physics, ocean modeling, and computational methods. Here is my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/CV-akaawase-2023.pdf).

I am original from Benue State, Nigeria, and I speak Tiv. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball and soccer, making food, blogging, and playing violin. 

<!-- Here is an assorted [list]({{ site.url }}/posts/book-movie-list.html) of books/movies/shows that I am currently on. -->
